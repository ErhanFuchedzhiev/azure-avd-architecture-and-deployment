# Azure Virtual Desktop Architecture & Deployment Project

In this project, I design and implement a complete Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) environment using modern identity, secure networking, FSLogix profiles, autoscaling, monitoring, and security hardening.

My goal is to demonstrate how I architect and deploy a real-world AVD solution — covering identity integration, profile management, session host configuration, cost optimisation, and production-grade security.

Each stage includes detailed documentation, screenshots, and configuration steps to make the environment easy to understand, learn from, or reproduce in your own Azure subscription.
